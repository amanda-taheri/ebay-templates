        <h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
        As car lovers ourselves, we know your vehicle is more than just transportation—it's something you take pride in. That's why we craft our seat covers with the same attention to detail and dedication that you put into maintaining your car. We strive for perfection in every detail to ensure a flawless result.<br><br>
        At DIY Auto Upholstery, we take pride in delivering <strong>superior quality seat covers</strong> that match or exceed OEM standards. We source only the finest <strong>automotive-grade upholstery materials</strong> from top suppliers to ensure <strong>durability, comfort, and a perfect fit</strong>.<br><br>
        
        Our <strong>genuine leather</strong> is carefully selected from leading suppliers in the USA and Brazil. We use thick <strong>top-grain leather</strong>, processed for <strong>UV resistance and long-lasting durability</strong>, preventing cracking, peeling, or fading over time. Unlike low-quality alternatives, our leather retains its <strong>original factory color</strong>. We never use dyes or artificial coatings.<br><br>
        
        For customers preferring <strong>synthetic leather</strong>, we use premium-grade materials sourced from reputable USA manufacturers, adhering to <strong>strict quality and environmental standards</strong>. Every seat cover is backed with a <strong>1/4-inch thick foam padding</strong>, enhancing both comfort and durability.<br><br>
        
      Each cover is handcrafted and rigorously <strong>tested for fitment</strong> before being packed and shipped from our <strong>Houston, USA</strong>, factory. We stand behind our craftsmanship with a <strong>100% money-back guarantee</strong>—because for us, quality isn’t just a promise, it’s a commitment.

        <h3>Important Notes</h3>
        <strong style="color:#b8860b;">DIY Instructions:</strong> While professional installation is recommended, many of our customers successfully install their seat covers themselves. If you’d like to attempt a DIY installation, we’re happy to provide our <strong>General Installation Guidelines</strong>. Please note that the process may vary based on your car's make and model.<br><br>
        
        <strong style="color:#b8860b;">Replacement Cover:</strong> This is a direct replacement cover—not a slip-on or pullover. Your original seat cover must be removed before installation.<br><br>
        
        <strong style="color:#b8860b;">Heating Element:</strong> If your seat cover includes a heating element, you may need to transfer the connector from your old cover to the new one. Contact us if you need assistance.<br><br>
        
        <strong style="color:#b8860b;">Airbag Components:</strong> These are not included and need to be transferred from the original cover where applicable.<br><br>
        
        <strong style="color:#b8860b;">Foam and Frame:</strong> These parts are not included.<br><br>
        
        <strong style="color:#b8860b;">Attachment Clips:</strong> The attachment clips are designed to match OEM specifications. If your original seat cover used 180-degree rotation clips, the new cover will install the same way. Some clips may also look slightly different from the original but function identically.<br><br>
        
        <strong style="color:#b8860b;">Access Cuts:</strong>To ensure compatibility with different seat models, we do not pre-cut openings for power buttons, headrests, seatbelts, or other seat features. These access cuts must be made during installation. The process is straightforward and ensures the best fit for your specific seat configuration.<br>

        <h4 style="color:#b8860b; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Fit &amp; Compatibility</h4>
        <strong>Q: How do I know if this seat cover will fit my vehicle?</strong><br>
        A: We're happy to help! Please send us a message with photos of your seats and the VIN sticker. <br><br>
        
        <strong>Q: Do your seat covers fit all original seat features?</strong><br>
        A: Yes! Our covers are designed to fit seamlessly with your vehicle’s adjustable controls, thigh supports, heating elements, and cooled seat systems, ensuring the same functionality as your original seats.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Q: Are your seat covers airbag compatible?</strong><br>
        A: Yes, our seat covers are airbag-compatible. However, the airbag components must be transferred from your original cover during installation. We strongly recommend professional installation to ensure safety and proper deployment.
        
        <h4 style="color:#b8860b; font-size: 20px;">Material &amp; Customization</h4>
        <strong>Q: How are your seat covers different from the original ones?</strong><br>
        A: Each of our seat covers is meticulously crafted to match your original cover in fit, feel, and appearance. We source premium upholstery materials from top suppliers to ensure durability, comfort, and a precise fit.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Q: How do you ensure the seat cover color and stitching match my car?</strong><br>
        A: We source auto upholstery materials with original factory colors from the best manufacturers. To ensure a perfect match, we may ask for photos of your seats and the VIN sticker. This helps us create your seat cover with an exact match in material, color, stitching, and perforation.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Q: Can I get seat covers with or without perforation?</strong><br>
        A: Yes! Some car models offer both perforated and non-perforated seat covers. To confirm availability, we may request photos of your seats and the VIN sticker to ensure the correct fit and style.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Q: My seat covers are a different material or color. Do you have this?</strong><br>
        A: We offer a variety of seat covers in different materials and colors, including genuine leather, synthetic leather, cloth (fabric), and Alcantara. If you can’t find your model or need assistance, please contact us—we’re happy to help!<br><br>
        
        <strong>Q: My original seat covers are synthetic leather. Can I upgrade to genuine leather?</strong><br>
        A: Yes! We offer genuine leather replacements for most seat covers. Contact us for availability and details.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Q: Can I customize the color and material of my seat covers?</strong><br>
        A: While we specialize in OEM-style replacements, we do offer custom options for most models. Contact us to discuss your customization needs. Please note that custom orders are final and non-returnable.
        
        <h4 style="color:#b8860b; font-size: 20px;">Installation &amp; Fitment</h4>
        <strong>Q: Do your seat covers come with foam cushions and frames?</strong><br>
        A: No. Our seat covers are designed to replace your original cover, which means you’ll need to remove the old seat cover and install the new one over your existing foam cushion and frame.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Q: Can I install the seat covers myself?</strong><br>
        A: While professional installation is recommended, many of our customers install their seat covers themselves with great results. No special tools are required—just basic hand tools and a little patience. If you need guidance, we’re happy to provide general installation tips.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Q: Where can I have my seat covers installed?</strong><br>
        A: Any professional auto upholstery shop can install our seat covers.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Q: I can’t attach the cover to the frame because the clip is stitched backward. What should I do?</strong><br>
        A: The clip needs to be rotated or folded inward (180 degrees) to properly attach to the metal frame.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Q: The covers I received don’t have pre-cut openings for the headrests, seatbelts, or power seat controls.</strong><br>
        A: Due to the many variations in seat designs, we do not pre-cut holes for power buttons, headrests, seatbelts, or other seat features. These access cuts must be made during installation for a perfect fit.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Q: The heating element connector is different from my original. What should I do?</strong><br>
        A: Our heating element is universal and may require some minor electrical work for installation. It has two wires, while some OEM heaters may have three or more. You may need to transfer the connector from your original seat cover to match your vehicle’s wiring. If you need guidance, feel free to contact us for detailed instructions.
        
        <h4 style="color:#b8860b; font-size: 20px;">Shipping, Tracking &amp; Warranty</h4>
        <strong>Q: How fast can I receive my seat cover? Do you offer expedited shipping?</strong><br>
        A: Our seat covers are custom-made at our Houston, Texas factory, with a typical handling time of 3-4 business days. We ship via UPS and USPS. If you need expedited shipping, please contact us, and we’ll check availability and pricing.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Q: Do you offer international shipping?</strong><br>
        A: Yes! We ship worldwide to almost every country.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Q: My tracking number shows no movement. What's happening?</strong><br>

        <strong>Q: Do you offer a warranty?</strong><br>
        A: Yes! We provide a 1-year manufacturer’s warranty, covering defects in materials and workmanship.
